# LeafLine: Plant Disease Classification Web App

LeafLine is an AI-powered web application for plant disease detection. Upload a plant leaf image and instantly receive a prediction of the plant type and its health status using a deep learning model. Built with a modern HTML/JS frontend and a Python Flask backend.

## Features
- Upload a plant leaf image and get a prediction (plant type and health status)
- Beautiful, responsive frontend
- Python Flask backend with TensorFlow/Keras model
- Logging of predictions for analysis
- Easy to run locally

## Setup & Usage

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Install dependencies**
   ```powershell
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(A `requirements.txt` is provided in the `backend/` folder with Flask, flask-cors, tensorflow, pillow, numpy)*

3. **Run the backend**
   ```powershell
   python api_backend.py
   ```
   This will start the Flask server and open the frontend in your browser.

4. **Use the app**
   - Go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) *or your localhost domain if changed*
   - Upload a plant leaf image and view the prediction.
